# Deep Learning with PyTorch Image Classifier Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll be building and training an image classifier using the CIFAR10 dataset, which includes classes such as 'airplane,' 'automobile,' 'bird,' 'cat,' 'deer,' 'dog,' 'frog,' 'horse,' 'ship,' and 'truck.' The images in CIFAR-10 have dimensions of 3x32x32, indicating they are 3-channel color images with a resolution of 32x32 pixels.

## Recommended Preparation

Before starting this tutorial it is recommended that you have installed [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index), and have a basic understanding of [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/doc/) and [PyTorch Tensors](https://github.com/darinz/DL-PT-Tensor):

### Google Colab

For tips on running tutorial notebooks in Google Colab, see [Colab Pytorch Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/colab)

### Conda Environment Setup

Use the first command to create new independent environment for the project. Or use the other two commands to remove or update the Conda environment.

```shell
# To create a conda environment.
conda env create -f environment.yml

# To remove a conda environment.
conda remove --name dl --all

# To update a conda environment when some new libraries are added.
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
```
Then, install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
